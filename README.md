# 🌱 Impact of Soil Quality on Crop Growth Analysis  

Agriculture is the cornerstone of many economies, ensuring food security and sustaining livelihoods. A fundamental determinant of agricultural productivity lies in understanding the influence of environmental factors on crop growth.  

This project — **Impact of Soil Quality on Crop Growth Analysis** — investigates the relationship between **soil quality** and **weather conditions** with crop growth and yield.

## 📌 Project Overview  

- **Soil parameters**: nutrient content, pH, and other soil quality indicators.  
- **Weather variables**: temperature, humidity, and rainfall.  
- **Goal**: uncover patterns and insights that can improve crop classification and selection across diverse regions.  

The analysis aims to guide **farmers** and **policymakers** in:  
✔ Optimizing crop selection  
✔ Improving agricultural outcomes  
✔ Promoting sustainable land management  
✔ Adapting practices to changing climate conditions
